# What is Bindex.tk?

Bindex.tk is a web application meant to make the task of managing senior community centers simple. We hope the final product will give members and staff the ability to keep track of everything your center offers with an easy-to-use and effective toolset:
* Administrator tools

   With Administrator tools, you'll be able to manage members and volunteers and all of their information.
   You'll also be able to use search tools to quickly access this information needed for printing forms, writing reports, and grant.
   In addition, you'll be able to create activities, services and meals that members can sign up for.

* Volunteer tools

   Volunteers will be able to log their hours, sign up for a specific position, and access basic information for members.

* Member tools

   Members will be able to view and edit their own information, sign up for and check into activities/meals
